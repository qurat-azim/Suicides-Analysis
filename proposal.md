# Suicides-Analysis-Dash Proposal

This report outlines the identified problem and proposed dashboard solution.

## Motivation & Purpose

Suicide is a serious public health issue that affects millions of people worldwide each year. According to the World Health Organization, suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds globally, and it is estimated that around 800,000 people die by suicide each year.

To better understand the scope and impact of this problem, we propose building a Dash app that provides an interactive platform for exploring data about suicides in different countries and years.

## Data Description

In this project , we are using theÂ [Suicide Rate overview(1985 to 2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargowda/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2021). This data set contains rate of suicides based on various socio-economic factors such as `country`, `GDP`, `age`, `gender` etc. 

The Kaggle Dataset is an extension of the original one, created by combining four other datasets that are related in terms of time and location. Its purpose is to identify patterns that may be linked to higher suicide rates across various demographic groups worldwide, spanning the full range of socioeconomic levels. It contains 31,756 global observations from 1985 to 2021 over 12 variables. 


## User Persona & Research Questions

**User Persona**:Our target audience for this app includes researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding the patterns and trends of suicides globally. Our user persona is Dr. Maria Sanchez, a public health researcher who specializes in suicide prevention.

Dr. Sanchez is a postdoctoral researcher at a leading university, where she conducts research on suicide prevention and mental health. She is interested in using data to better understand the factors that contribute to suicide risk, and to identify effective prevention strategies.

Dr. Sanchez is comfortable using statistical software and programming languages such as R and Python, but she is not an expert in web development. She is looking for an interactive tool that allows her to explore global suicide data easily and efficiently, without requiring extensive programming skills.

**Example Use Case Research Questions (Primary tasks [bolded])**:
The app will help Dr. Sanchez and other users answer the following research question:

- What are the patterns and trends of suicides globally, and how do they vary by country, year, gender, and age range?
To answer this question, the app will provide users with access to a comprehensive dataset of suicide data from multiple countries and years. Users will be able to interact with the data using a simple and intuitive interface, allowing them to explore trends and patterns visually and to identify potential areas for further research.
