# Suicides-Analysis-Dash Proposal

This report outlines the identified problem and proposed dashboard solution.

## Motivation & Purpose

Suicide is a serious public health issue that affects millions of people worldwide each year. According to the World Health Organization, suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds globally, and it is estimated that around 800,000 people die by suicide each year.

To better understand the scope and impact of this problem, we propose building a Dash app that provides an interactive platform for exploring data about suicides in different countries and years.

## Data Description

The [Suicide Rates Overview dataset]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargowda/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2021)), available on Kaggle, provides information on suicide rates for different countries across the world, spanning from 1985 to 2021. The dataset is collected from various sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank.

The dataset consists of 12 columns, including country, year, sex, age group, population count, suicide count, suicide rate, GDP, GDP per capita, HDI, HDI category, and generation. The country column lists the name of the country, the year column represents the year in which the data was recorded, and the sex column indicates the gender of the individual who committed suicide. The age group column specifies the age group of the individual, and the population count column provides information on the total population of the country in that particular year. The suicide count column specifies the number of suicides recorded for a given demographic group, while the suicide rate column represents the number of suicides per 100,000 people in that particular demographic group.

The dataset also includes information on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita of each country in that particular year, as well as the Human Development Index (HDI) and HDI category, which provide an overall measure of a country's well-being. The generation column categorizes individuals based on their birth year, such as Silent, Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, and Generation Z.

Overall, the Suicide Rates Overview dataset provides a comprehensive view of suicide rates and demographic patterns across the world. It can be used to identify trends and patterns in suicide rates over time, as well as to investigate the impact of various economic and social factors on suicide rates. The dataset has been used in various studies and research projects, and it continues to be a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers alike.


## User Persona & Research Questions

**User Persona**:Our target audience for this app includes researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding the patterns and trends of suicides globally. Our user persona is Dr. Maria Sanchez, a public health researcher who specializes in suicide prevention.

Dr. Sanchez is a postdoctoral researcher at a leading university, where she conducts research on suicide prevention and mental health. She is interested in using data to better understand the factors that contribute to suicide risk, and to identify effective prevention strategies.

Dr. Sanchez is comfortable using statistical software and programming languages such as R and Python, but she is not an expert in web development. She is looking for an interactive tool that allows her to explore global suicide data easily and efficiently, without requiring extensive programming skills.

**Example Use Case Research Questions**:
The app will help Dr. Sanchez and other users answer the following research question:

- What are the patterns and trends of suicides globally, and how do they vary by country, year, gender, and age range?

To answer this question, the app will provide users with access to a comprehensive dataset of suicide data from multiple countries and years. Users will be able to interact with the data using a simple and intuitive interface, allowing them to explore trends and patterns visually and to identify potential areas for further research.
